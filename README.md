# Skype4BusinessArtefacts-
3 August 2018

Collection and extraction Skype for Business (SfB) user artefacts.

These scripts are part of a research that (a.) identifies SfB files containing evidential user artefacts and (b) develop a solution to discretely collect from Windows clients and present these artefacts in a report that is easily interpretable for tactical forensic investigators.
Goal is to enhance the ability to gather SfB communication artefacts on an ad-hoc basis without depending on the delivery of metadata logging from system administrators. In practice this often is a delaying factor in fraud investigations where time is a key element. 
Since none of the existing commercial and free software supports this solution,  the goal is to contribute to digital forensics community by sharing the SfB artefacts and improving the digital forensic investigationsâ€™ quality through gaining insight in more communication sources.

Be aware that these two scripts are still in a raw, initial, state and will be improved in a later stage. Main future work is to create one Python/PowerShell script and support error handling.

Dependencies and work instructions can be found in the Work Instruction document.
